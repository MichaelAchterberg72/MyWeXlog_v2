In order to edit the information on your public profile you need to navigate to the drop down icon menu at the top right hand corner of the screen and select 'Edit Profile’ this will open the profile capturing information screen.</p>
    <p>On the ‘Review Your Profile’ page you will see a number of cards. Each card will have information relative to the specific heading.  Click either ‘Edit’ or ‘Add’ at the top of each card heading to change or update the information in your public profile.</p>
