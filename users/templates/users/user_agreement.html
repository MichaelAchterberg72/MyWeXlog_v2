<!--DEV-L(POL)DI002#42R00_01~MyWeXlog User Agreement-->
<h2>User Agreement</h2>
<p>Effective on 25 May 2020</p>
<br>

<p>MyWeXlog is there to enable the Members to record their career and education history, with audited testimonials, to make their services known to potential employers, and to find opportunities and work, and to make decisions in a network of trusted relationships.</p>
<br>
<h3>Affordable Experience Tracking with Quality Vacancies</h3>
<p>MyWeXlog's mission is to create a portal that is aimed at allowing people to capture their experience and have it ratified or signed off by their clients / superiors or peers whilst providing a portal for vacancies.</p>
<p>MyWeXlog is designed to allow people who have been working for several years and have a large amount of experience that may not be able to be authorised as they no longer work with those clients or at the company any longer. The portal allows people to capture this time, however this is displayed as such.</p>
<p>The captured time will then be saved against their profile, available for people to search for that experience.</p>
<p>Once captured, clients requiring skills or services should perform a search and find people with the required experience. The results would be displayed in terms of distance from the prospective client, experience and ratings.</p>
<br>
