
<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Effective 23 May 2020</p>

<br>
<h3>Introduction to our Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Ever since our founding, the data privacy and security of our Users has been core to our mission and is close to our hearts.</p>
<p>Some of us at MyWeXlog indeed come from a computer and data security background. </p>
<p>Since our launch we published and followed a comprehensive, transparent privacy policy.</p>
<p>We believe you deserve to know what data we collect from you, and that you deserve to know how we use and protect this data.  We also believe you deserve control over your data.</p>
<p>We use your data to provide our service to you and to continually improve our service for your benefit. We have based this policy on internationally accepted and legislated policies and regulations from several jurisdictions including Europe, the Americas and Australasia as well as other regulations from other countries. Whenever we become aware of a standard that exceeds our current standards, we make every effort to incorporate it.  This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information including personal data and other information that is collected from or provided by our users.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, if you know of any area where you feel we could improve, please let us know.</p>
<br>
<h3>The MyWeXlog Terms of Service</h3>
<p>The <strong>MyWeXlog Terms of Service</strong> is our contract with our users.  This contract governs the shared responsibilities and expectations of both MyWeXlog and our users. By using MyWeXlog, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this privacy policy. When a User registers to create an account at MyWeXlog, they agree to abide by the MyWeXlog Terms of Service, and they agree to receive email communications so we can provide them with the standard features off MyWeXlog and other services.</p>
<br>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>We believe privacy policies and procedures should be clear, transparent, and in written plain language.</p>
<p>Essential to this clarity is a common understanding of key terminology used in this Privacy Policy.  Here, we summarise some of the key terms and definitions.  Some of these terms are referred to in the European Union’s new GDPR privacy policy, effective May 25, 2018, which MyWeXlog supports:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Data</strong> - Personal Data is data about a living individual that can be used to determine, directly or indirectly, the identity of the user.   The data subjects are identifiable if they can be directly or indirectly identified, especially by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, a photograph, an online identifier attached to the individual’s physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity or one of several special characteristics, which expresses the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, commercial, cultural or social identity of these natural persons. In practice, these also include all data which are or can be assigned to a person in any kind of way.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Data</strong> - Usage Data is data we collect automatically based on your use of any associated services.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong> - Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a user’s web browser or device.  MyWeXlog uses Cookies to streamline your login and enable greater customization and personalization of our service.</p>
<p><strong>Data Controller</strong> - Data Controller means the natural or legal  person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the manner in which your personal data is, or is to be, processed.  For the purpose of this privacy policy, MyWeXlog acts as a Data Controller.</p>
<p><strong>Data Processor</strong> - Data Processor (or Service Provider) means any natural or legal person (other than an employee of MyWeXlog) who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller.  For the purpose of this privacy policy, MyWeXlog also acts as a Data Processor.  Additionally, we may use the services of various 3rd Party Service Providers in order to process your data more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Data Subject</strong> - Data Subject is any living individual who is the subject of Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>GDPR</strong> - European Union's General Data Protection Regulation Act.</p>
<p><strong>DNT</strong> - Do Not Track, our DNT clause states whether we use tracking cookies and how to disable them.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong> - this will include the MyWeXlog User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.</p>
<p><strong>User</strong> - The User is the individual using MyWeXlog. The User corresponds to the Data Subject, who is the subject of Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>MyWeXlog</strong> - means MyWeXlog Private Limited, Company’s Information and 32 Viewland Crescent, Thornlands, Queensland, Australia, 4164.</p>


<br>
<h3>Principles for processing personal data</h3>
<p>Our principles for processing personal data are:</p>
<p><strong>Fairness and lawfulness</strong>. When we process personal data, the individual rights of the Data Subjects must be protected. All personal data must be collected and processed in a legal and fair manner.</p>
<p><strong>Restricted to a specific purpose</strong>. The personal data of Data Subject must be processed only for specific purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>. The Data Subject must be informed of how their data is being collected, processed and used.</p>

<br>
<h3>MyWeXlog Registration is Optional</h3>
<p>It’s not necessary to become a registered active user of the MyWeXlog website to enjoy many of our services.  This means it’s not necessary to provide MyWeXlog any personally identifiable information if you do not choose to do so.</p>
<p>However, if you desire to register your work history, testimonials and other data on MyWeXlog, or to access the data of those who have provided this information, or if you want to take advantage of our full range of the enhanced service features provided at no cost, you are required to sign up for an account.</p>

<br>
<h3>Choose a Robust Email/Password Combination to Protect Account Access</h3>
<p>MyWeXlog utilizes a number of computer security best practices and procedures to protect access to the personally identifiable data collected and stored at MyWeXlog.  However, the most important access control starts with you.  When you register for an account, MyWeXlog will prompt you to provide a unique and robust passphrase along with a unique username.</p>
<p>Your username and passphrase will serve as your login credentials.  To prevent unauthorized access to your account, it’s important you select a username/passphrase combination that you have never used at any other website.  Otherwise, if you’re using the same username/passphrase combination at MyWeXlog that you use elsewhere, and if that other website or service is later hacked and your login credentials stolen, it could allow those criminals to randomly try logging into other popular websites such as MyWeXlog to gain access to your account.  As a user of the MyWeXlog service, please help us help you by selecting a robust and unique passphrase.  We recommend using a password manager to assist in creating a unique passphrase.   Bottom line, choose a passphrase at MyWeXlog that you have never used anywhere else. Should you wish to change your passphrase or have forgotten your passphrase please select the ‘Change Password’ link provided in the Icon menu at the top right of the page and follow the required procedures. Should you have forgotten your passphrase please click on the “Forgot Password’ link on the log-on page and follow the prompts. </p>
<p>In addition, we recommend that you configure multi-factor authentication upon account creation through your profile security settings.</p>
<p>By design, MyWeXlog limits the amount of personally identifiable information that could be stolen should a criminal gain access to your account.  We do not store credit card numbers as this is handled by our payments partner PayPal.  We also strive to avoid collecting information we don’t need.</p>
<br>
<h3>Get More out of MyWeXlog by Registering for an Account</h3>
<p>We require personal information to create an account at MyWeXlog so that we may provide you the full range of services described in the MyWeXlog Terms of Service.</p>

You agree that data transfer may occur on a world-wide basis and agree to have the information you post on MyWeXlog made available to other users of MyWeXlog in the functioning of the MyWeXlog service. After having been informed of the possible risks of such transfers and that  the transfer is necessary for the performance of the contract between the data subject and the controller you agree to make use of the service provided by MyWeXlog and that the information you make available will be used for that service.</p>
<br>
<h3>Legal basis for collecting and processing personal data</h3>
<p>MyWeXlog legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described in this Data Privacy and Protection Policy depends on the personal data we collect and the specific context in which we collect the information:</p>

  <li>MyWeXlog needs to comply with the law</li>
</ul>
<br>

<ul>
  <li>To match skills of a person to vacancies available.</li>

  <li>To identify what skills are experiencing shortages in general as well as within geographic areas.</li>

<br>
<h3>How we Protect and Store your Information</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All data in transit and at rest is protected with encryption, using strong, collision-resistant hashing algorithms with reasonable work factors.</li>
  <li>We ensure that we are using the latest security standards and protocols at all times.  As such, we support TLS 1.2+</li>

</ul>
<p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data both in transit and at rest using strong cryptographic algorithms, We cannot guarantee its absolute security. Please <a href="https://mywexlog.com/public/data-protection-officer/">contact us</a> for more information.</p>

<br>
<h3>Information Collected on This Site</h3>
<p>For all visitors to the MyWeXlog website, we automatically collect aggregated and anonymized data such as browser type, useragent strings, page views, clickstream, and usage.  We use analytics services for this data tracking service. Because this information is aggregated and anonymized, it’s not visible to the general public.  It’s only visible to key MyWeXlog employees and is used to help us optimize the performance and usability of the site.</p>
<p>In addition to the anonymized analytics collected above, we may also work with similar services to monitor purchase transactions and detect fraud.  We also utilise the information you capture to provide a better tailored service to you in services such as suggesting skill tags that you should capture, suggesting books and courses that would benefit you, identifying skills that would assist your development or assist you in securing vacancies better, skills that are needed in specific areas or what areas require your skillset as well as other enhanced services to make your MyWeXlog experience better.</p>
<p>We also track IP addresses, account logins, profile views; and books viewed, sampled, commented on and purchased.</p>
<p>For merchandising and promotion purposes, we leverage anonymous aggregated sales data to make automated recommendations and display content that matches your interests.  We may also use your browsing or purchase history to improve your discovery experience by recommending products and services similar to those you’ve purchased or enjoyed in the past.</p>
<br>
<h3>“Do Not Track”</h3>
<p>With your DNT rights you are able to turn off the tracking in your browser with the following settings</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-za/help/4533959/microsoft-edge-learn-about-tracking-prevention">Microsoft Edge</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://help.opera.com/en/latest/security-and-privacy/">Opera</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2790761?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en">Google Chrome</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-turn-do-not-track-feature">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
</ul>
<p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn't an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don't respond to them at this time. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.</p>

However, any information you voluntarily upload or post to the site, such as personal profile information, becomes publicly available to other users of the site, should through the functioning of the site it needs to be shown. The public does not have unlimited access to your information. We only disclose your name and email address once you have accepted a vacancy or an interview. Up to that stage you are known by your alias only.</p>

Otherwise we do not expose your registration email on the website.</p>

<p>We may sell aggregated and anonymous data to third parties.  We may sell or rent out the email contact information for MyWeXlog users.  </p>
<p>If a third party claims to know you and requests your contact information, we will not share your contact information.  In these cases, we will forward the inquiry to you privately and leave it to you to reply.</p>
<p>However, if there's a business reason to share your email expeditiously with a trusted business partner, and we're confident that by doing so we're providing you greater service, then we will do so.</p>
<p>MyWeXlog, like many businesses, will collaborate with other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such categories or functions include data services that host our website or data files; certified public accountants which help us manage tax reporting and compliance, or the customer service software company that hosts our customer service platform. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>
<p>One of the partners that MyWeXlog uses is PayPal, a copy of their privacy policy may be found <a href="https://www.paypal.com/en/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">here</a>.</p>
<p>MyWeXlog may be compelled to disclose information in order to comply with a legal demand against which MyWeXlog may not have legal grounds to refuse. If such an event occurs, MyWeXlog undertakes to use its best efforts to notify consumers if their data has been requested by third parties due to legal requirements.</p>
<br>
<h3>Data protection rights</h3>

<p>You also have the ‘right to be forgotten’. Also known as the "right to erasure", the rule gives EU citizens the power to demand data about them be deleted.

You may exercise this right by selecting the ‘Right to be forgotten’ checkbox from the Settings menu to delete your account entirely or alternatively contact us (through the feedback loudhailer at the top of every page) to have selected information deleted.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:</p>
<ul>

<ol>
  <li>comply with a legal obligation,</li>
  <li>protect and defend the rights or property of MyWeXlog and our users,</li>
  <li>act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our service or others (such as if we become aware of a threat to harm oneself or others),</li>
  <li>protect against legal liability,</li>
  <li>or we’re compelled to do so to protect our users and partners against fraud.</li>
  <li>We may share limited data with our retailers and media partners, such as recent sales rankings or other accumulation totals.  To promote our Members, we will share information authorised by them with persons who have a code issued to them via the Member.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Change of Control</h3>
<p>In the event of a change in control of MyWeXlog ownership (i.e. MyWeXlog is acquired by another company), or preliminary discussions to that end, your personal data may be included so the acquirer may continue to serve you</p>
<br>
<h3>MyWeXlog Email Policy</h3>
<p>Earlier we mentioned we may sell or rent out the email addresses of our users to third parties.</p>
<p>In this section, we summarize how we use email at MyWeXlog to communicate with our users. </p>
<p>In order for us to provide you the services described in the MyWeXlog website, we must be able to communicate with you.  At MyWeXlog, this communication takes place almost exclusively by utilising your registration email.  When you sign up for a MyWeXlog account, you are giving us permission to contact you so that we may fulfill our service duties to you. </p>
<p>Most of these communications are automated or semi-automated based on event triggers.  These functions may be turned on and off in the “Settings” according to your personal preferences. In all cases, such communications will be germane to the reason you joined MyWeXlog in the first place.</p>
<p>If you state on your account that you provide a certain service, or if an enquiry is received requesting a testimonial for your work, you will receive an exclusive “MyWeXlog Alert” to notify you of this enquiry. You will also receive information on important service developments, best practices recommendations, and policy changes. </p>
<p>We will only send these emails once a week should you have accumulated information to respond to. If you are not yet a member we will only email you once for each time a different member who has a past business history with you captures your email as a reference for validation to their education or work performed.   We also email requests from our members to join the site and become a member.</p>
<br>
<h3>You control your communication settings.</h3> <p> </p>
<p>All subscription-based or communication emails contain one-click ’Unsubscribe’ opt-outs, and users can also manage their communications settings by clicking to ‘Settings’ to adjust the emails received settings.</p>
<p>However, some emails will not have opt-outs because they’re one-off emails sent manually by a MyWeXlog employee helping you solve an issue, or a semi-automated email to notify you of a critical issue with your account that’s blocking publication.</p>
<p>Subject to the above MyWeXlog does not allow third parties to send emails to our registered users. Email addresses are only revealed on the website when the vacancy selection process has been completed and an interview or vacancy has been accepted.

<h3>Advertising on the MyWeXlog Site</h3>
<p>MyWeXlog may run third party advertisements on the MyWeXlog site and therefore works with ad services or ad tracking firms that might seek to track your habits as you browse the web.</p>
<br>
<h3>Children's Guidelines</h3>
<p>We market our service to adults.  We do not market MyWeXlog to children. </p>
<p>During site registration when a user signs up for our service, we ask the user to inform us if they’re under or over 16 years of age.  If they tell us they’re under the age of 16, we do not allow them to register.</p>
<p>If MyWeXlog learns that a child has posted personally identifiable or private information that would allow others to contact or identify the child, MyWeXlog will remove the information.</p>
<br>
<h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
<p>At MyWeXlog, we link to a lot of websites.  For example, every registered MyWeXlog user has the ability to publish their social media hyperlinks on their MyWeXlog profile page, including links to their personal website, blog, Facebook or Twitter as well as for locations of online books and courses.  The MyWeXlog Privacy Policy applies only to MyWeXlog, not to these third-party destinations.</p>
<p>In keeping with our intention to keep all our Members anonymous, other MyWeXlog users will never be able to view any sites you post on your profile. MyWeXlog uses these sites as a method to prevent fraud and to confirm you are who you say you are.</p>
<br>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>MyWeXlog applies multiple best practices and techniques to protect the personal data of our users from misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction. However, no Internet business or email transmission can ever be fully secure or error-free, and therefore we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>Security tip:  Email communications are inherently insecure.  We ask that MyWeXlog publishers never transmit sensitive personal information over email, such as tax identification numbers.  Instead, we provide secure encrypted means to collect this important information over secure web forms on our site that use industry-standard encryption.  In the case of the tax identification numbers, you can enter them under Account:  Payment Settings.</p>
<br>
<h3>Account Closure</h3>
<p>You have the option to close your account at any time.  By closing your account, all publicly visible information about the User on MyWeXlog will be deleted.</p>
<p>Users who wish to close their MyWeXlog account can do so by clicking with the “<a href="{% url 'Users:CustomUserSettings' %}">Settings</a>” from the icon menu at the top of any MyWeXlog page and selecting the ‘Right to be forgotten / Permanently delete my account’ checkbox.</p>
<p>Please think carefully before requesting account closure.  If you have a specific concern that might prompt you to want to close your account, please share it with our support team.  Often, our team can suggest even better options that will meet your privacy needs but still allow you to continue benefiting from the MyWeXlog service.</p>
<br>
<h3>Changes to the MyWeXlog Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This privacy policy has changed little since we introduced MyWeXlog to the world.
At MyWeXlog, we welcome the intent and purpose of GDPR and the Australian APP’s.  We hope it inspires a renaissance in terms of how all Internet companies use, respect and protect the personal private data of their users.</p>
<p>It can be expected that in future months and years, we will continue to take opportunities to modify our policies when we think such changes are in the best interests of our users.  In the future, where appropriate, we’ll look for opportunities to introduce new privacy options in the spirit of GDPR.  Such actions might include the creation of new tools that give you even more control over your private information.</p>
<p>Should the privacy policy be changed we will notify our members by email communication as a system required notification with details of the relevant effective date changes. The privacy policy will also have the effective date changes and a brief detailing of the changes affected.</p>
