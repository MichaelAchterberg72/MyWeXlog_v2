  <h3>Experience Home Page - Education & Training - Help</h3>
    <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p>The experience is listed in date order with, in
      the 'Education and Training', the 'Start Date, 'Completion Date', Course' and
      'Time Logged', and 'Score' data items with the most recent date first.</p>
    <p>The ‘Education and Training’ card contains an abbreviated list of the five most recent
      relevant captured experience.</p>
    <p>Score is a required calculated entity. A minimum score of 3 per
      captured experience item is required to allow the experience item to be incorporated
      into the experience totals.</p>
    <p>The experience validators are calculated on the following basis:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>lecturer_score = 2</li>
        <li>classmate_score = 1</li>
      </ul>
    <p>You are able to open the full list by clicking on the 'View All Education' button as
      required. This button will only be visible once you have more than five items in
      the list.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are able to add a new experience entry by clicking on the
          ‘Add Education’ button at the top right of the experience card.
          Education and Training is self describing in that it is where you
          can capture all time spent studying or on course. Time logged against this is
          not counted in your overall experience rating.</li>

      </ul>
    <br>
    <p>The options you will be provided with will be:</p>
    <table class="table table-sm">
    <col width="10%">
    <col width="70%">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="text-center"><a href="#" class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary" style="width: 5rem;">Detail</a>
          </td>
          <td>Allow you to view the detail of the entry.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
