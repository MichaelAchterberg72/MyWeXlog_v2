    only list the five most recent items.</p>
    <p>You are able to open the full list by clicking on the
      'View All Experience' button as required. This button will only be visible when you

    <p><strong>Pre-Logged Experience</strong></p>
    <p>Pre-logged experience is experience that is captured for which you have approved
      timesheets from the past. It allows you to capture all the experience you have
      throughout your career.</p>
    <br>
    <p<strong>Parameters for Capturing Experience</strong></p>
    <p>When capturing experience or pre logged experience the system has been designed
       a few parameters and logic.</p>
       <ol>
         <li>You cannot enter a 'date_to' that is after today</li>
         <li>The 'date_from' must be less than or equal to the 'date_to'</li>
         <li>Capturing experience is limited to no more than:
           <ul>
             <li>12 hours per </li>
             <li>6 × 12 hours per week</li>
             <li>52 × 6 × 12 hours per year</li>
             <li>6 × working days per week (will vary)</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ol>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Ensuring you have a sufficient validation Scores</strong></p>
    <p>Score is a required calculated entity. A minimum score of 3 per
      captured experience item is required to allow the experience item to be incorporated
      into the experience totals.</p>
    <p>The experience validators are calculated on the following basis:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>client_score = 2.5</li>
        <li>colleague_score = 1.5</li>
        <li>collaborator_score = 1</li>
        <li>superior_score = 2</li>
      </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>What can be Claimed as Experience</strong></p>
    <p>There are a number of activities that can be classified as experience, These are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Time spent working at your day job</li>
        <li>Time spent working at a freelancer job</li>
        <li>Time spent "working" on social club / sports club committees</li>
        <li>Time spent on governing bodies
          <ul>

            <li>Housing estates</li>
            <li>Charity Work</li>
            <li>Etc</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>Time spent volunteering for a charity or at a place of worship.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>Once experience has been captured you will need to tag skills used during that time.</p>
    <p>This can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Government departments that were dealt with</li>
        <li>Computer programs used</li>
        <li>Laws being worked with</li>
