  <h3>Experience Home Page - Work Experience - Help</h3>
    <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p>The experience in the list is listed in date order  only the five most recent
      experience items listed, in the 'Work Experience' the
      'Employer, 'Date from', 'Date to', 'Hours' and 'Project' data items with the most
      recent date first.</p>
    <p>You are able to open the full list by clicking on the
      'View All Experience' button as required. This button will only be visible once
      you have captured a minimum of six work experience items.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are able to add a new experience entry by clicking on the relative
          ‘Add Experience’ button at the top right of the experience type
          card.</li>
        <li>Logged experience is experience that has been logged within 2 weeks of having
          completed the work. Any experience that is older than this will be tagged as
          being “estimated”.</li>
        <li>Previously logged experience is past experience for which you already have a
          timesheet and want to upload it to MyWeXlog. A copy of the timesheet will need
          to be uploaded when claiming the experience.</li>
      </ul>
    <br>
    <p>The options you will be provided with will be:</p>
    <table class="table table-sm">
    <col width="10%">
    <col width="70%">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="text-center"><a href="#" class="badge badge-pill badge-secondary" style="width: 5rem;">Detail</a>
          </td>
          <td>Allow you to view the detail of the entry.</td>

          </td>

        </tr>

    <p><strong>Experience</strong></p>
    <p>Experience should be captured within 14 days of the capture date or else it must
      be captured as estimated experience. The reasons behind this are that it is difficult
      to remember with any certainty what you did, in the case of capturing, or what someone
      else did, in the case of validations, more than two weeks in arrears.</p>
    <p>This means that you should log-in and capture your experience at least every week
      or at the worst every fortnight.</p>
    <br>
    <p<strong>Parameters for Capturing Experience</strong></p>
    <p>When capturing experience or pre logged experience the system has been designed
       a few parameters and logic.</p>
       <ol>
         <li>You cannot enter a 'date_to' that is after today</li>
         <li>The 'date_from' must be less than or equal to the 'date_to'</li>
         <li>Capturing experience is limited to no more than:
           <ul>
             <li>12 hours per </li>
             <li>6 × 12 hours per week</li>
             <li>52 × 6 × 12 hours per year</li>
             <li>6 × working days per week (will vary)</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ol>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Ensuring you have a sufficient validation Scores</strong></p>
    <p>Score is a required calculated entity. A minimum score of 3 per
      captured experience item is required to allow the experience item to be incorporated
      into the experience totals.</p>
    <p>The experience validators are calculated on the following basis:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>client_score = 2.5</li>
        <li>colleague_score = 1.5</li>
        <li>collaborator_score = 1</li>
        <li>superior_score = 2</li>
      </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>What can be Claimed as Experience</strong></p>
    <p>There are a number of activities that can be classified as experience, These are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Time spent working at your day job</li>
        <li>Time spent working at a freelancer job</li>
        <li>Time spent "working" on social club / sports club committees</li>
        <li>Time spent on governing bodies
          <ul>
            <li>School</li>
            <li>Housing estates</li>
            <li>Charity Work</li>
            <li>Etc</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>Time spent volunteering for a charity or at a place of worship.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>Once experience has been captured you will need to tag skills used during that time.</p>
    <p>This can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Government departments that were dealt with</li>
        <li>Computer programs used</li>
        <li>Laws being worked with</li>
        <li>Case Law you worked with</li>
        <li>Regulations you worked with</li>
        <li>Codes and standards you worked with</li>
        <li>Activities (report writing)</li>
        <li>Skills (coding, meetings, research, etc.)</li>
        <li>Commodities you worked with (Gold, platinum, coal, etc.)</li>
        <li>Country where the work was performed (shows familiarity with customs etc.)</li>
        <li>Many, many others...</li>
      </ul>
