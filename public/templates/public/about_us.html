    and quality vacancies.</p>

  <h3>Who we are</h3>
  <p>WexLog.io is a division of DevOpTec (Pty.) Ltd (ABN: 0000) a tech company formed in
    the territory of Queensland, Australia. WexLog began in the early months of 2019 and
    was officially launched in October of 2019.</p>
  <p>James Keir is the CEO of the company and the management includes experienced executives
    with experience in programming, database administration, data security and business
    development.</p>
  <p>WexLog is a supplemental portal to other portals aimed at professional people who
    capture their experience via static means: CV’s, etc.. We directly capture a person’s
    experience, provide a trust passport and provide access to international work prospects.</p>
  <p>We directly quantify the experience of individuals, companies as well as for the
    people that work within them.</p>
  <p>&nbsp</p>
  <h3>Mission</h3>
  <p>WexLog's mission is to create a portal that is aimed at allowing people to capture
    their experience and have it ratified or signed off by their clients / superiors /
    peers whilst providing a portal for vacancies.</p>
  <p>WeXlog is designed to allow people who have been working for several years and have
    a large amount of experience that may not be able to be authorised as they no longer
    work with those clients or at the company any longer. The portal allows people to
    capture this time, however this is displayed as such.</p>
  <p>The captured time will then be saved against their profile, available for people
    to search for that experience.</p>
  <p>Once captured, clients requiring skills or services should perform a search and
    find people with the needed experience. The results would be displayed in terms of
    distance from the prospective client, experience and ratings.</p>
    <p>&nbsp</p>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>The working world is moving toward a gig economy at an increasing rate. In this
      economy, people offer their skills on a freelance basis, marketing their abilities
      through their networks. There are methods through which people can market their
      abilities available, however these methods are static and do not give an indication
      as to the level of experience a person has apart from the length of their working
      career.</p>
    <p>These methods are also inconsistent in that a person that has over 10 years
      overall experience, in construction for example, but has only been involved in
      airport construction for 1 year does not easily get noticed.</p>
    <p>Similarly, in the service industry, people do not know what experience
      technicians/mechanics etc. have when it comes to their particular needs. If you
      had an Audi diesel, you would want to identify the mechanic that has the most
      experience with that car as well as whether they offer a quality service.</p>
    <p>In the service industry it is possible to rate a person’s service using platforms
      currently available, however, that rating may be made by a person that does not
      know your car. Indeed, the mechanic in question may be an expert on another model
      but know very little of yours.</p>
    <p>In the professional services industry one can source skills from a global market,
      but the question remains: How do you find people with ratified experience in the
      field you require.</p>
    <p>The concept of a timesheet is familiar with many people in the legal, engineering,
      accounting, and many other fields. But this system is designed to measure the
      amount of work performed for billing purposes.</p>
    <p>By extending this system, one can add the knowledge and skill used in performing
      that work and build up a knowledge base which is approved by a client or superior,
      not simply added in an uncontrolled fashion.</p>
    <p>&nbsp</p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>WexLog is designed to be a system that creates a trust passport of verified
      experience on a dynamic level capturing the training and education as well as
      the work experience skills.</p>
    <p>No matter what industry you work in, you need to be able to quantify the
      skills that you developed over the lifespan of your career and provide a
      marketable portfolio that you will be able to send to your prospective clients,
      employers or colleagues to qualify who you are and what experience you have in
      the performance of your work.</p>
    <p>The WexLog solution allows you to do that is a concise, dynamic method by
      capturing your experience in continual daily, weekly or bi-weekly updates.
      This ensures that you have a full portfolio available at the click of a button
      to apply for a vacancy or bid that is available.</p>
