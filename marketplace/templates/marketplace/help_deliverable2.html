  <h3>Vacancy Deliverables - Help</h3>
    <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p>This page allows you to add deliverables to the vacancy. A deliverable is a tangible
      or intangible good or service produced as a result of a project that is intended to
      be delivered to a customer. A deliverable could be a report, a document, a software
      product, a server upgrade or any other building block of an overall project.</p>
    <p>Each deliverable must be written in point form as a single point, then another
      added.</p>
